    <p class="bio">
      My name is Danielle and I grew up in a small farm town in New Hampshire.
      I graduated from Minnie College in 2019 and have been living in Boston ever since.
      Outside of work I like to cook, spend time outside, read, watch reality TV, 
      and spend time with friends, family, and my cat Finn.
